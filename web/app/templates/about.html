           <h1>About the ASRC Weather Station</h1>
    <p > The objective of this fellowship is to set up a rooftop personal weather station on the CUNY Advanced Science Research
      Center building. The intent of this project is to collect local weather data and compare it to data-sets from other
      stations across New York City such as those at Central Park, JFK, and LaGuardia. The unit being used is Davis Vantage
      Pro2+ personal weather station. The information collected from this weather station will provide useful data such as
      frequent updates of rainfall quantities, barometric air pressure, wind direction, wind speed, UV radiation and solar
      radiation, and forecasted weather for the next 12 hours. This data will be compared with data from other weather stations
      across New York City to aid in the analysis of urban heat island locations, flooding and drainage requirements due
      to precipitation, and to visualize weather patterns across Metropolitan area of New York City. The data from the Vantage
      Pro2 will be primarily be used to facilitate student research at the ASRC. The collected data also has potential to
      be used by other scientists and engineers for industry related use as it will be uploaded to platforms such as WeatherLink
      and Weather Underground where it is accessible to the public. This weather station is a prototype for a larger network
      of personal weather stations which will be deployed throughout other locations in New York City. After initial setup,
      the Vantage Pro2 will need to be maintained regularly through once a week inspections of hardware failure due to exposure
      to the elements. This includes maintenance of the anemometer, rain collector cups, and ensuring the unit is clear of
      debris and grime. Weekly checks to ensure that data is continuously collected and stored securely. These steps will
      facilitate future research which has potential be used for projects which can aid in city planning to accommodate the
      everchanging weather and climate.

          <h3> CUNY ASRC </h3>
              <p>The City University of New York’s Advanced Science Research Center hosts several research initiatives including: Nanoscience, photonics, structural biology, neuroscience, and the environmental sciences. The ASRC building is located on the City College of New York’s south campus in uptown Manhattan attracting talented and distinguished researchers from across CUNY campuses. Within the ASRC, collaboration between disciplines are highly encouraged as the building is designed with a large central stair-way to increase collaboration and partnerships between labs. The ASRC features a nanofabrication facility, nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometers, data analytic centers, a rooftop observatory and now a rooftop personal weather station.

        <p> This personal weather stations. The information collected from this weather station will provide useful data such as hourly updates of rainfall quantities, barometric air pressure, wind direction, wind speed, UV radiation and solar radiation, and forecasted weather for the next 12 hours. The instruments include: pyranometer, radiometer, anemometer and wind vane, Temperature and humidity sensor, and a rain collector unit.

           <h3> Dr. Bernice Rosenzweig </h3>
    <p>Bernice is a research associate with the Environmental Science Initiative at the CUNY ASRC. She earned her PhD in environmental engineering from Princeton University and has authored several publications regarding hydrology, metabolism, and resilience of local and regional-scale socio-eco-technical systems.
    Bernice manages the Trellis Bridge summer program for incoming transfer students to the City College of New York, where she teaches new students the foundations of data analysis, mapping software, and climate science. The objective of the Trellis program is to prepare community college transfer students for the rigors of a four-year university.
    Students from the Trellis program are encouraged to apply for fellowships funded by the NSF where students have the opportunity to work directly with professors conducting undergraduate research. One such fellowship has students studying directly under Bernice, studying climate science and implementing hardware for this roof-top personal weather-station.

          <h3> Shivron Sugrim </h3>
    <p> Shivron is a mechanical engineering student tasked with deploying the Vantage Pro2+ weather station. Previous work entailed the set-up, trouble-shooting, ensuring wireless connectivity, and streamlining of data collection. Once set-up, the data collected needed to be displayed to the public through a dedicated website. A custom website was designed by creating our own HTLM/CSS templates to better highlight the importance of climate data. </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    Shivron is an aspiring aerospace engineer who aims to one day be involved in research or design of cutting-edge technology to send the people of our generation to Mars. Shivron graduates in December 2019 with a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering with a minor in math. With several years of research experience, he aims to use his skillset to further the advancement of technology related to the aerospace industry.
